Connects to a broadband login server via an automated browser
using selenium and logs in. This is repeated after a certain
interval of time such that the connectivity doesn't gets
disrupted while the user is away (This happens often with my ISP
and my downloads gets interrupted). Just an informal little piece
of code.
